# This file is used for post-processing of the pybind11-stubgen generated stubs.
# The file is a yaml file where:
# - the key is text that will be matched (pure string match, no wildcards/regular expressions), and
# - the value is the replacement text.
#
# This will be used in the first instance to replace all list[int] with tuple[int, ...]
# rather than using `stub_replacmeent_funcs.yaml` on every function that takes a vector<int>.
"list[int]": "tuple[int, ...]"
