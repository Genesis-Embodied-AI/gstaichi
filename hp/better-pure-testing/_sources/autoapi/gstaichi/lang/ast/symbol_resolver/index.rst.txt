.. py:class:: ASTResolver

   Provides helper methods to resolve AST nodes.


   .. py:method:: resolve_to(node, wanted, scope)
      :staticmethod:


      Check if symbol ``node`` resolves to ``wanted`` object.

      This is only intended to check if a given AST node resolves to a symbol
      under some namespaces, e.g. the ``a.b.c.foo`` pattern, but not meant for
      more complicated expressions like ``(a + b).foo``.

      :param node: an AST node to be resolved.
      :type node: Union[ast.Attribute, ast.Name]
      :param wanted: The expected python object.
      :type wanted: Any
      :param scope: Maps from symbol names to objects, for
                    example, globals()
      :type scope: Dict[str, Any]

      :returns: The checked result.
      :rtype: bool
